    "# Code of Conduct for Jupyter Notebook Template Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our Jupyter Notebook environment. To ensure a productive and respectful environment, we have established a few ground rules. Please adhere to this Code of Conduct when using our Jupyter Notebook templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Notebook Structure**\n",
    "   - This notebook has a specifc structure that should be respected and not to be tempered with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Integrity in Coding**\n",
    "   - Write clear, commented, and understandable code.\n",
    "   - Acknowledge and credit external sources or contributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Data Privacy and Security**\n",
    "   - Handle sensitive data responsibly.\n",
    "   - Do not share confidential information without proper authorization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Collaboration and Sharing**\n",
    "   - Collaborate effectively with others.\n",
    "   - Share knowledge and help fellow users when possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Responsible Resource Usage**\n",
    "   - Use computational resources judiciously.\n",
    "   - Avoid unnecessary computational tasks that can overload the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook is split in three parts:\n",
    "   - The First Part is a cell that gets and loads the data that was selected beforehand. (This cell needs only to be run, **not modified**.)\n",
    "   - The Second Part is a cell in which the preparation for data is done. (This cell can be modified, but only to prepare the data in format for a specific ML model, not to make any other modifications on the data.)\n",
    "   - The Third Part is compose of three cells. \n",
    "      - The first cell can be modified to prepare the model for training and train it.\n",
    "      - The second cell can be modified to save the metrics in a json file, and the metrics shoud be saved as key value pair.\n",
    "      - The third cell can't be modified, in this cell the saving of the model and metrics is realized.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Also at the begging of the notebook is a cell in which additional modules can be added, put only from standard library, **other modules can not be installed**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reporting Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter any issues or observe violations of this Code of Conduct, please report them to [jarcau.stefan.cristian@gmail.com](jarcau.stefan.cristian@gmail.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By adhering to these guidelines, we can maintain a healthy, productive, and welcoming environment for all users. Thank you for your cooperation and happy coding!\n"
